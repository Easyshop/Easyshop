*What is the difference between product container, categories and groups?*

Product container is an internal way to structure the products physically.

Categories and groups are ways to combine products. This is not physically, hence a product can have more categories and groups at the same time.

Categories are displayed to the shop customers (it can be considered as the navigation for the shop)

Groups are not displayed to the shop customers. In this way products can be combined internally. Later the groups can be used to assign something to all products of a group at once. At the moment this are product properties, taxes, shipping prices/methods, payment prices/methods, discounts and stock information.

*Why can I not see the PayPal payment methods?*

You must first provide your PayPal id within the payment tab of the shop content object.
