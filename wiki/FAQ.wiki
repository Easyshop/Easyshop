*What is the difference between product containers, categories and groups?*

 * Product containers are an internal way to structure the products physically.
 * Categories and groups are ways to combine products. This is not physically, hence a product can have more categories and groups at the same time.
 * Categories are displayed to the shop customers (it can be considered as the navigation for the shop)
 * Groups are not displayed to the shop customers. In this way products can be combined internally. Later the groups can be used to assign something to all products of a group at once. At the moment this are product properties, taxes, shipping prices/methods, payment prices/methods, discounts and stock information.

*Why is the PayPal payment method not there?*

 * You must first provide your PayPal id within the payment tab of the shop content object.

*I know EasyShop is open source and free. Is there professional support anyway?*
