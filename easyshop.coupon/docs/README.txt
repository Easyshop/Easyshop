EasyShop Coupon Manager
=======================

Overview
--------

Manage coupon or voucher IDs for EasyShop.

Adds a "Coupon Manager" container to your EasyShop instance(s) where you can
add/generate coupon/voucher IDs which give you a certain ammount (cash or
percent) of discount to your cart.

coupon IDs have a start/end date, so you can provide a code  within a daterange.

The main difference between coupon and discount is, that a generated coupon ID 
can be entered in a field at @@checkout-order-preview page and that this ID
is stored to your customer account. This ensures that the ID is only entered
once per customer.
