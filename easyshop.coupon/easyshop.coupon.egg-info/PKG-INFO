Description: EasyShop Coupon Manager
        =======================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Manage coupon or voucher IDs for EasyShop.
        
        Adds a "Coupon Manager" container to your EasyShop instance(s) where you can
        add/generate coupon/voucher IDs which give you a certain ammount (cash or
        percent) of discount to your cart.
        
        coupon IDs have a start/end date, so you can provide a code  within a daterange.
        
        The main difference between coupon and discount is, that a generated coupon ID
        can be entered in a field at @@checkout-order-preview page and that this ID
        is stored to your customer account. This ensures that the ID is only entered
        once per customer.
